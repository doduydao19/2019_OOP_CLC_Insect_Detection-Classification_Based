# In here you need download pre_train model on: 
  https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md
# Choose pre-train models you need.  
# In my paper , I chosen model ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco to detec on Raspbbery Py
# After downloaded successfully, you extract to ../workspaces/pre_train_model/

# With once pre_train model have to speed and mAp other, you need choose model fit your dataset.
